# Anomaly Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on **anomaly detection** using **machine learning**, analyzing **network packet data** and real-world datasets to identify potential security threats. The model is designed to detect abnormal patterns using datasets like Twitter training data and `.pkt` network packet files.

## Features
- **Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection**
- **Network Packet Analysis using Scapy**
- **Supports CSV and `.pkt` File Processing**
- **Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score**

## Requirements

### 1. Install Python (v3.8 or later)
Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### 2. Install Required Libraries
Run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow scapy
